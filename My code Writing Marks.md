# Packages in RESTful
the main packages that will be created for each projects are:

Classes (some call them Objects)
Databases (for who need an inner database)
HelperClasses (some call them DAOServices)
Controllers(some call them JPAResources or Resources)
ExceptionsClasses

there could be more packages depend on the project or the programmer and his method
Some programmers create Packages and name it by the Object name, and insert everything related to that object inside the package
